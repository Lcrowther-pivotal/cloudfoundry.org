**SAN FRANCISCO, December 9, 2014** – Cloud Foundry Foundation, the global standard for open Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), today is announcing its launch as an independent nonprofit foundation. The Cloud Foundry Foundation will be managed as a Linux Foundation Collaborative Project and operate under a system of open governance created by a team of open source experts from founding Platinum Members EMC, HP, IBM, Intel, Pivotal, SAP and VMware. 

Cloud Foundry is the leading Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) open source project and has seen a 36-percent increase in community contributions and more than 1,700 pull requests in the last year. The project is also being used in a variety of commercial deployments including Pivotal Cloud FoundryⓇ, IBM BluemixⓇ, HP HelionⓇ and Canopy Cloud Fabric among others. These achievements coupled with new investments from an expanded membership advance and accelerate application development in the cloud era. As a Linux Foundation Collaborative Project, the Cloud Foundry Foundation will also benefit from the industry’s deepest pool of open source expertise and guidance on best practices for management, operations, advocacy and governance. 

The Cloud Foundry Foundation is also implementing a new approach to open source development called Dojo. This offers developers a unique “fast track” for commit rights, which often take more than a year to gain in a major project. A certification program will also be introduced in the new year to ensure consistency and compatibility across Cloud Foundry-branded products and services.

Recent technical features and community contributions to the project include:

+ Docker support for Diego (early release available for testing)
+ Ability to FUSE devices in containers
+ Firehose: app logs and Cloud Foundry component metrics stream
+ Expanded build pack support for Go, PHP, Python and more
+ Internationalization and extensibility model for Cloud Foundry CLI
+ BOSH external Cloud Provider Interface (CPI)

The rise of the DevOps role in the enterprise and the increasing number of multi-cloud environments makes the PaaS market one to watch. Research firm IDC forecasts for PaaS are increasingly aggressive with the latest data showing about 27% estimated annual growth in the market over the 2013-2018 period.* The establishment of the Cloud Foundry Foundation will enable a strong ecosystem to support this growth and advance the state-of-the-art for open cloud.
