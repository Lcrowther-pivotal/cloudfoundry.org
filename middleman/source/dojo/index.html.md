# Cloud Foundry Dojo

### Open Source, Open Cloud, Open Door

Cloud Foundry Dojo is a unique learning experience beyond anything offered in the industry! Master Cloud Foundry by working shoulder to shoulder in the San Francisco Lab on the open-source project with the core team of Pivotal engineers, developing software the Pivotal Labs way. Qualified engineers from the Cloud Foundry community can participate in pair programming with the Cloud Foundry engineering team at Pivotal, gain invaluable experience with the core technology, and make direct contributions to the codebase. Participation typically lasts 6-12 weeks.
