# Jobs

The Cloud Foundry Foundation is currently looking for amazingly smart, high energy people to join the team. To apply, please email <a href="mailto:jobs@cloudfoundry.org">jobs@cloudfoundry.org</a>.

## <a name="evangelist"></a>Technical Evangelist

*San Francisco, CA or Remote*

The Cloud Foundry Foundation is seeking a high energy evangelist to join the foundation’s team to grow the already active global Cloud Foundry community.

You have embraced cloud-native application architecture and operations practices.  You understand the wants, needs, and desires of developers and operations teams, and have empathy for their context as you’ve worked inside IT at global enterprises.  You know that changing behavior at scale from monoliths and waterfalls to cloud-native and agile is hard, and you want to give the right cognitive tools to everyone who is driving this kind of change.

You love travel and enjoy speaking at events and meetups, demonstrating software, and teaching people your skills. In your experience there’s nothing as satisfying as seeing people “get it” when they are sharing their ideas and experiences about technology to solve problems.  

You have strong hands-on technical experience, having written production code and lived with the results long after it shipped.  You know in your bones that engineers who carry pagers write better code.  You’ve had responsibility for building and managing production systems and empathize with IT ops professionals.

Finally, you understand the power of a diverse human network to sustain and grow technology communities, and you know how to help build lasting connections between people.  You look at a long-term, healthy global community of devs, ops and others as a meaningful legacy which you are profoundly motivated to build.  You believe that diversity of race, gender, sexual orientation, and life experience are all dimensions of a powerful community and will work to create strength through harmony.

If you take on this role, you will be a key member of the Cloud Foundry Foundation staff, driving evangelism activities across dozens of member companies, setting global evangelism strategy, initiating successful events (both large and small) and leading the market education activities for the Foundation. You will also play a key role in gathering and sharing the needs of the broader user community with Cloud Foundry product managers and engineers.  You will set the global standard for technical content for the Cloud Foundry community.

*Requirements*

* Strong and diverse technical skills: You are passionate about current development technologies across different platforms.
* Strong communications skills are essential to serve in this role, you have a portfolio of blog posts and other written work that showcases your powerful writing skills.
* Social networking skills: You thrive on getting out and connecting with people about technology.
* Public speaking ability for inspiring technical audiences. You develop and deliver presentations that are effective and respectful of an audience's time and attention.
* Willingness to travel to where our communities live. You are productive and professional on the road/inside and outside business settings.
* Ability to work irregular hours and occasional weekends to support meetups, conferences, user groups, and other events.
* Entrepreneurial thinking and the ability to act effectively with only high-level direction is critical.
* You have 3-5 years of experience in product management, sales engineering, or technical evangelism for PaaS and/or IaaS platforms
* In a past life, you were a Software Engineering or DevOps professional
* You have a history and passion for solving hard problems while remaining profoundly optimistic
